          An expert software dedicated to plastic gears optimization Apart the
          usual software that are currently used in mechanics engineering for
          plastic parts such as CADs systems, FEA and other rheological
          analysis, our study department felt the need to develop from the 90's,
          its own expert software which purpose is to define and optimize gears
          and gear-trains according to customers requirements (torque to
          transmit, overall dimensions, environmental conditions, noise
          reduction...). Our software takes into account physical properties of
          the various plastic materials that can be chosen. This engineering
          tool is of valuable support to carry-out our studies and to share with
          our customers the best gear design : - The reason why it is so good -
          How it will operate at limits of the various parameters such as
          temperature, moisture, fatigue, backlash and tolerance limits...
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, up-to-date technologies such as 3D CAD, Moldflow analysis,
          FEA,.. are of valuable help to take up this challenge that consists in
          designing tools for precision gears but here again, the experience and
          the know-how of our design and tooling engineers remain our most
          important strength.
